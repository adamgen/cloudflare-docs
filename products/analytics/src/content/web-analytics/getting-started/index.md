1. Go to [Get started with Web Analytics](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/web-analytics).

4. Wait for the redirect to the Web Analytics page or click **View Analytics**. It may take a few minutes for Web Analytics data to appear.

Repeat steps 4-6 for all of the websites you want to track with Web Analytics. For more information on how many sites you can track, refer to [Limits](../understanding-web-analytics/limits/).

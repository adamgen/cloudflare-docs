# About Web Analytics

Cloudflare Web Analytics helps you understand the performance of your web pages as experienced by your site visitors.

To enable Web Analytics, Cloudflare writes and injects a piece of JavaScript code (also known as a beacon) that collects certain pieces of information into your web pages. More specifically, this beacon collects metrics using the Performance API, which is available in all major web browsers.

Web Analytics only reports data from 10% of page loads. If Cloudflare has handled fewer than 10 page loads, we likely will not have metrics to report. Check back after more users have visited your website.

The data displayed in Web Analytics is real user monitoring (RUM). For more information, refer to [What is Real-User Monitoring?](https://smartbear.com/learn/performance-monitoring/what-is-real-user-monitoring/).

Note: Web Analytics now includes the functionality formerly enabled through Browser Insights.
